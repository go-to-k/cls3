## Interactive Mode

### BucketName Selection

In the interactive mode(`-i` option), you can search bucket names and select buckets.

It is designed to be searchable and deletable **across regions**, so it can be used **without being region-aware**.

It can be **empty**.

```sh
‚ùØ cls3 -i
Filter a keyword of bucket names: test-goto
```

Then you select bucket names in the UI.

```sh
? Select buckets.
  [Use arrows to move, space to select, <right> to all, <left> to none, type to filter]
> [x]  test-goto-bucket-1
  [ ]  test-goto-bucket-2
  [x]  test-goto-bucket-3
```
