## What is

The CLI tool **"cls3"** is to <ins>**CL**</ins>ear Amazon <ins>**S3**</ins> Buckets(AWS).

It <ins>empties</ins> (so deletes all objects and versions/delete-markers in) S3 Buckets or <ins>deletes</ins> the buckets themselves.

This tool allows you to **search for bucket names** and empty or delete **multiple buckets**.

## Features

### Bucket deletion option

Initially, the tool was intended to "empty the bucket", but since I was going to go through the trouble, I also added an option (`-f|--force`) to "delete the bucket as well".

### Search for bucket names and delete multiple buckets

As described below ([Interactive Mode](#interactive-mode)), you can **search for bucket names** and delete or empty **multiple buckets at once**.

### Cross-region

In deleting multiple buckets, you can list and delete them all at once, even if they are in multiple regions.

(In the **Directory Buckets** Mode for S3 Express One Zone (`-d` option), operation across regions is not possible, but only in **one region**. You can specify the region with the `-r` option.)

### Deletion of buckets with versioning enabled

Even if versioning is turned on, you can empty it just as if it were turned off. Therefore, you can use it without being aware of the versioning settings.

### Deletion of old version objects only

The `-o | --oldVersionsOnly` option allows you to delete only old versions and all delete-markers without new versions and a bucket itself.

**So you can retain the latest version objects only.**

This option cannot be specified with the `-f | --force` option.

### Deletion of Directory Buckets for S3 Express One Zone

The `-d | --directoryBucketsMode` option allows you to delete the Directory Buckets for S3 Express One Zone.

In this mode, operation across regions is not possible, but only in **one region**. You can specify the region with the `-r` option.

### Deletion of Table Buckets for S3 Tables

The `-t | --tableBucketsMode` option allows you to delete the Table Buckets for S3 Tables.

In this mode, operation across regions is not possible, but only in **one region**. You can specify the region with the `-r` option.

### Concurrent Deletion of Multiple Buckets

The `-c | --concurrentMode` option allows you to delete **multiple buckets in parallel**. By default, when this option is specified, all buckets will be deleted in parallel.

If you want to limit the number of parallel deletions, you can specify the `-n | --concurrencyNumber` option. For example, `-c -n 5` will delete buckets with a maximum of 5 parallel operations.

**Too many parallel deletions may cause S3 API errors.** If it fails, please run it again.

This option is not available in the Table Buckets Mode (`-t`) because the throttling threshold for S3 Tables is very low.

### Number of objects that can be deleted

The delete-objects API provided by the CLI and SDK has a limit of "the number of objects that can be deleted in one command is limited to 1000", but This tool has no limit on the number.

### Retry on 503 error

When there are tens of thousands of objects, a SlowDown error (503 error) may occur on the S3 api side in rare cases when deleting them all at once using the CLI or SDK.

When this occurs, cls3 responds by adding a mechanism that waits a few seconds and retries automatically several times.

## How to use

  ```bash
  cls3 -b <bucketName> [-b <bucketName>] [-p <profile>] [-r <region>] [-f|--force] [-i|--interactive] [-o|--oldVersionsOnly] [-q|--quietMode] [-d|--directoryBucketsMode] [-t|--tableBucketsMode] [-c|--concurrentMode] [-n|--concurrencyNumber <number>]
  ```

- -b, --bucketName: optional
  - Bucket name
    - Must be specified in **not** interactive mode
    - Otherwise (so in the interactive mode), you **can not** specify this!
  - Multiple specifications are possible.
    - `cls3 -b test1 -b test2`
- -p, --profile: optional
  - AWS profile name
- -r, --region: optional(default: `ap-northeast-1`)
  - AWS Region
    - If this option is not specified and your AWS profile is tied to a region, the region is used instead of the default region.
  - It is not necessary to be aware of this as it can be used **across regions**.
    - But in the Directory Buckets Mode for **S3 Express One Zone** (with `-d` option), you should specify the region. The mode is not available across regions.
- -f, --force: optional
  - ForceMode (Delete the bucket together)
    - If you specify this option with -t (--tableBucketsMode), it will delete not only the namespaces and the tables but also the table bucket itself.
- -i, --interactive: optional
  - Interactive Mode for buckets selection
- -o, --oldVersionsOnly: optional
  - Delete old version objects only (including all delete-markers)
  - Do not specify the `-f` option if you specify this option.
- -q, --quietMode: optional
  - Hide live display of number of deletions
  - It would be good to use in CI
- -d, --directoryBucketsMode: optional
  - Directory Buckets Mode for **S3 Express One Zone**
  - Operation across regions is not possible, but only in **one region**.
    - You can specify the region with the `-r` option.
- -t, --tableBucketsMode: optional
  - Table Buckets Mode for **S3 Tables**
  - If you specify this option WITHOUT -f (--force), it will delete ONLY the namespaces and the tables without the table bucket itself.
- -c, --concurrentMode: optional
  - Delete multiple buckets in parallel.
  - If you want to limit the number of parallel deletions, specify the -n option.
  - **Too many parallel deletions may cause S3 API errors.** If it fails, please run it again.
  - This option is not available in the Table Buckets Mode (-t) because the throttling threshold for S3 Tables is very low.
- -n, --concurrencyNumber: optional
  - Specify the number of parallel deletions.
  - To specify this option, the -c option must be specified.
  - The default is to delete all buckets in parallel if only the -c option is specified.

## Interactive Mode

### BucketName Selection

In the interactive mode(`-i` option), you can search bucket names and select buckets.

It is designed to be searchable and deletable **across regions**, so it can be used without being region-aware.

It can be empty.

```bash
‚ùØ cls3 -i
Filter a keyword of bucket names: test-goto
```

Then you select bucket names in the UI.

```bash
? Select buckets.
  [Use arrows to move, space to select, <right> to all, <left> to none, type to filter]
> [x]  test-goto-bucket-1
  [ ]  test-goto-bucket-2
  [x]  test-goto-bucket-3
```

## GitHub Actions

You can use cls3 in GitHub Actions Workflow.

The `quiet` allows you to hive live display of number of deletions (**default: true in GitHub Actions ONLY**).

Basically, you do not need to specify a `region` parameter, since you can delete buckets across regions. However,
in Directory Buckets mode (`directory-buckets-mode`) for S3 Express One Zone and Table Buckets mode (`table-buckets-mode`)
for S3 Tables, the region must be specified. These modes cannot be used across regions.

To delete multiple buckets, specify bucket names separated by commas.

```yaml
jobs:
  cls3:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v3
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role
          # Or specify access keys.
          # aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          # aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Delete bucket
        uses: go-to-k/cls3@main # Or specify the version instead of main
        with:
          bucket-name: YourBucket
          # bucket-name: YourBucket1, YourBucket2, YourBucket3 # To delete multiple buckets
          force: true # Whether to delete the bucket itself, not just the object (default: false)
          quiet: false # Hide live display of number of deletions (default: true in GitHub Actions ONLY.)
          old-versions-only: false # Delete old version objects only (including all delete-markers) (default: false)
          directory-buckets-mode: false # Directory Buckets Mode for S3 Express One Zone (default: false)
          table-buckets-mode: false # Table Buckets Mode for S3 Tables (default: false)
          region: us-east-1 # Specify the region in the Directory Buckets Mode for S3 Express One Zone and Table Buckets Mode for S3 Tables
          concurrent-mode: true # Delete multiple buckets in parallel (default: false)
          concurrency-number: 8 # Specify the number of parallel deletions (requires concurrent-mode to be true)
```

You can also run raw commands after installing the cls3 binary.

```yaml
jobs:
  cls3:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v3
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role
          # Or specify access keys.
          # aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          # aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - name: Install cls3
        uses: go-to-k/cls3@main # Or specify the version instead of main
      - name: Run cls3
        run: |
          echo "cls3"
          cls3 -v
          cls3 -b YourBucket1 -b YourBucket2
```
